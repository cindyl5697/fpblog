Today I made 4 files to add information about Accounting.  (Where are you at in the process of your product? See hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp)

I learned â€¦.  (What are you learning in class that applies directly to your project? How will you use the synthesis practice we did today on your project?)

I used github.com and ide.cs50.io (What sources did you use to learn that? Some days this will just be class instruction.)

A skill that I used was creativity to add information and design the file. How are you developing in ways that apply outside of your project? See hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills
